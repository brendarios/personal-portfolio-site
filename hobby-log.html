        <h2>Closing Chapters</h2>

        <p>
          No se necesita salir a vivir al extranjero para decirle adiós a algo o alguien.
          En muchas situaciones de nuestra vida tenemos que tomar decisiones que implican terminar o cambiar algo.
          Pocas cosas son más difíciles que cerrar capítulos en nuestras vidas. Sin embargo, hacerlo nos
          permite crear nuevas historias y nuevas experiencias que irán formando nuestro libro de la vida.
          Es común que sin darnos cuenta, en vez de escribir nuevos capítulos, no dejamos de leer la misma
          página pues no deseamos soltar el pasado o simplemente la rutina, zona de confort o esa “burbuja”
          en la que vivimos no nos permite escribir nuevas historias.
        </p>

        </figure>
        <p>
          Al día de hoy, la vida me ha dado la oportunidad de cerrar muchos capítulos de mi vida con grandes recuerdos y experiencias provenientes de fracasos y dificultades.
          Esto ha significado 4 cambios de país o ciudad, 4 veces empacar y desempacar mudanzas, 4 veces volver a empezar.
          Cuatro capítulos que no solamente requerían valentía para empezarlos, sino también voluntad.
          Por más valientes que seamos, nada sucede sin voluntad.
        </p>

        <p>
          Aún recuerdo cuando amigos y familia me decían antes de irme a Argentina, “Eres muy valiente por irte a vivir a un país desconocido”.
          En ese momento, pensaba que Sí que tal vez era yo muy valiente. Pero al llegar a Argentina me di cuenta que yo no necesitaba ser valiente para vivir ahí.
          No tardé mucho en darme cuenta de que lo único que necesitaba era voluntad. Valiente es aquél que enfrenta un peligro.
          Valiente sería aquel que se va a vivir a una zona de guerra. Yo no estaba ante ningún peligro.
          Al contrario, solamente estaba en una nueva ciudad iniciando un cambio en mi vida en el sólo requería de mi voluntad para enfrentarlo y aprender de él.
          No sólo vivir en el extranjero es un gran cambio. El matrimonio, alguna enfermedad, pérdida de algún ser querido, cambio de trabajo,
          también son grandes cambios, que realmente modifican tu vida y por lo general vienen acompañados por situaciones difíciles que la sacuden.
          Pero definitivamente, cuando un cambio es un gran desafío, no es el fin del mundo, es el inicio de un nuevo capítulo que pronto formará parte de tu libro de la vida.
        </p>

        <p>
          Los 4 grandes cambios que hemos vivido como familia me han enseñado a reducir mi vida en unas cuantas maletas.
          Ante tanto cambio, no hemos tenido la oportunidad de acumular bienes materiales pues hemos preferido deshacernos de cosas en cada mudanza y volver a empezar.
          Hemos aprendido a vivir con lo básico, con lo que necesitamos. Ha sido difícil desprenderse de muebles, ropa e incluso objetos de recuerdo,
          pero cada mudanza ha servido como filtro para desprendernos de las cosas que sólo ocupan espacio y contribuyen a la acumulación de cosas innecesarias en el hogar.
          Tal vez para muchas mujeres sería imposible guardar todo su guardarropa en 2 maletas de 25 kgs. Pues en mi caso no lo es. Con las mudanzas he aprendido a conservar lo que realmente uso y necesito.
        </p>

        <p>

          Incluso mis hijos han vivido la experiencia de desprenderse de cosas que alguna vez fueron especiales para ellos.
          Durante la mudanza de Brasil a Estados Unidos, el espacio era muy limitado por lo que Santiago y Juan Pablo escogieron
          los juguetes que continuarían con ellos y los que habría que dejar en ese país. Para mí también fue difícil dejar aquella primera carpeta
          de dibujos del kinder de Santiago en Argentina, o las primeras obras de arte de Juan Pablo en Brasil,
          pero lo resolví tomándole fotos y así poder recordar su “arte” sin tener que acumularlos.
        </p>

        <p>
          Cada mudanza no sólo ha implicado vender y comprar. Cada mudanza nos ha enseñado que sólo debemos acumular
          en nuestro corazón recuerdos y experiencias. De cada mudanza nos hemos llevado desafíos, errores, locuras, pero sobretodo
          amistades, aprendizajes, y cariño por países que nos brindaron la oportunidad de vivir nuevas y grandes experiencias y
          formar un nuevo capítulo. Dale un toque de locura a tu vida y dale la vuelta a esa página en la que tanto has permanecido.
          “Poder decir adiós es crecer.” (Gustavo Cerati)

        <h2>My expat of 5 years old</h2>

        <p>
          How to raise happy children abroad with strong ties to their extended family (grandparents, uncles, cousins, etc.)?
        </p>

        <p>
          If you are expat with small children you will be familiar with the image of your 8-month-old son crying when the visiting
          grandparents arrive and they try to take him in their arms. This can be difficult for everyone in the family and an effort
          is needed to create that important link despite the distance. As expats we have an ally called "technology".
        </p>

        <figure class="figures">
          <img src="img/santiago.jpg" alt="Santiago" height="400px" width="350px">
          <figcaption>Fig.1 Santiago, my oldest son</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          The technological advances have allowed that today we can make calls and virtual talks at any time. In fact, I can not
          imagine what it would be like for an expat without technology and even without social networks. But I think the issue of
          the expatriate with technology deserves another post. Today I would like to talk about what my eldest son has learned by
          living practically all his life abroad but above all what he has taught me.</p>

          <p>
            Santiago was born more than 5 years ago in the city of Monterrey, N.L., Mexico. After 2 months, he began his expatriate
            life in Argentina. From there, his life has been joined by 4 countries, 5 different cities, more than 20 international
            flights, 5 schools (Argentina 1, Brazil 2, EUA 2) and endless adventures. Regardless of the languages ​​he has learned,
            as an expat child, Santiago has learned other, much more important things.
          </p>

          <p>

            He has lived in Monterrey, NL (Mex), Buenos Aires, B.A. (Arg), Joinville, SC (Bra), Maryville, TN (USA) and currently lives
            in a city called Rockledge, FL, just 30 minutes from Orlando, FL (USA). Of all these cities you know which is your favorite
            city and where he would like to live forever? MONTERREY! Still and today lives 30 minutes from DISNEY! Anyone could think that
            the dream of every child is to be a neighbor of Mickey Mouse! But even though he only lived his first 2 months of life there,
            his answer is still Monterrey. The reason is simple: because their grandparents, cousins, uncles, aunts, etc. live there. and
            he receives a lot of love and time of coexistence when he visits them.
          </p>

          <p>
            During his last birthday, one of the gifts I gave him was a video where his grandparents, uncles, cousins ​​and his Mexican family
            from Brazil sent him greetings. I never imagined that the video would move him so much. When he saw it, his face fell apart and
            his eyes shrieked with nostalgia and longing for wanting to celebrate his birthday with all those people he wants but could only
            see through that video. Only to see his face of happiness but at the same time of nostalgia, I got a lump in my throat because I
            knew that my son wanted to celebrate his birthday with all of them. When I asked him if he liked it, he said "Thank you, mamãe,
            the video was my best gift."
          </p>
          <p>
            At that moment I realized that Santiago had learned to value family and that the best gifts do not have to be material things.
            Sometimes we go out of our way to give them toys or we worry about having the fashion toy but the reality is that they are happy
            with the love of their family.
          </p>
          <p>
            At his young age, Santiago has also learned to be strong. During the first visits we made to Monterrey or when grandparents visited
            us at home, there were always tears in the farewells. He even questioned me why he could not live near his grandparents like all the
            children in his school. For Santiago, it was difficult to accept that his mother and father attended the celebrations of the day of
            the grandfather in his school.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, one day while returning to the United States after a visit to Monterrey, I asked him why he was not crying anymore and with
            that innocence he replied: "I'm sad but even though we cry, we'll get on the plane!" He got used to goodbyes? Maybe, but in that
            moment I understood that Santiago was learning to cope with his sorrows, to be strong and to accept what life presents him.
            It is also amazing how after the visits, he returns to his happy daily life without any problem.
          </p>
          <p>
            With this he has taught me that everyone is responsible for their own happiness and that there must be a balance between creating ties
            and knowing how to get rid of memories or some material good.

          <h2>Three times new mom</h2>

          <p>
            Life allowed me to be a mother three times in three different countries.
            If you are pregnant with your first baby or if you already had a child, you will agree with me that there is a lot of uncertainty about
            what this great day will be like. Living pregnancies in 3 different countries allowed me to feel that uncertainty 3 times, but above all,
            to verify that in maternity, NOTHING is right or wrong. Simply, each mother must choose the upbringing of her children.
            AND THAT will be fine for them.

          </p>

          <p>
            My first baby was born by cesarean section in Monterrey, Mexico. City where more than 60% of babies are born by caesarean section.
            Mind you, I am not against cesarean births (I have 3 perfectly healthy children born by caesarean section). Simply, life showed me
            the reality in other countries.
          </p>

          <figure>
            <img src="img/lucy_brazil.jpg" alt="lucy with Brazil flag" height="400px" width="355px">
            <figcaption>Fig.1 My daughter Luciana, that was born in Brazil</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>
            When the big day came that I became a mother, it was probably similar to that of many women in Mexico who are blessed to have access
            to private services. Santiago was born at 8:25 am, they took me to the recovery room and the baby to the nursery area.
            By noon, in my room already decorated were family, aunts, friends, ready to show their affection and meet our baby (always grateful for
            those displays of love!).
            <p>
              Even with the typical problems of a new mother, I started breastfeeding. However, the third month believing that my baby "did not fill"
              we started with the formula. Just in that third month began our life as expatriates in Argentina. I still remember, when we went to the
              pediatrician, and the Argentine doctor, he tells me, does the baby take mother's milk right? When I answered that NO, surprised but at
              the same time almost confirming, he questioned me if I had suffered any illness or any kind of problem that prevented me from doing it.
            </p>

            <p>
              It was at that moment that I realized that we had moved to a country where breastfeeding is much more driven than in our country.
              Wherever you walk, you can find mothers breastfeeding without any shame. Clarifying that I do not tell exhibitionists to my Argentine
              friends, but I could see mothers feeding their children in the park, in the restaurant, in the doctor's office, even in the supermarket!
              Some covering more than others but nobody makes morbid about it. Simply, in Argentina it is something beautifully NATURAL!
              While for me in Monterrey it was not (at least 5 years ago) and breastfeed in public or think about it.
            </p>

            <p>
              In Monterrey, if you are in a meeting and your baby happens to want to eat. If you are lucky, it will not take long for someone to kindly
              tell you that you can safely move to another room so that you feel comfortable. In the best case, or in cases of more confidence, the
              mother takes out her "blanket" to cover herself and feed the baby.
              After enjoying our first baby for 20 months, we once again enjoyed the news of the arrival of a second child. We had decided to be born
              there in Argentina. From the care of the pregnancy that the doctors give to the mothers I realized that this second pregnancy would be
              very different.
            </p>
            <p>
              I still remember during my first consultation with my first Argentine obstetrician recommended widely.
              I remember that we entered his office and his office to my liking had few devices called an ecograph. "Doctor, will we see the baby today?"
              He had only 6-7 weeks of gestation. "I will give you the order (prescription) to go with your preferred sonographer," he replied,
              surprised by my question.
            </p>
            <p>
              No good!! We left my husband and I thinking we should find another doctor. How was it possible that an obstetrician did not have ultrasound
              equipment? If my obstetrician in Mexico had a team up in 3D and month to month for 9 months we would see the baby on an LCD screen and every
              appointment we went out with CD in hand !!
            </p>
            <figure>
              <img src="img/my_kids.jpg" alt="my_kids" height="400px" width="380px">
              <figcaption>Fig.2 Santiago, Juan Pablo and Luciana</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
              Soon we had the contact of one of the most recognized obstetricians in the city of Buenos Aires and we decided to change doctors.
              What was our surprise that this doctor also did not have ultrasound equipment in his office !! We realized that in Argentina, ultrasound
              scans are not performed every month and, in addition, they are not performed by the obstetrician. The sonographer performs the ones that
              are necessary and perform them in 3D or 4D is not so common. After 9 months the time of birth had arrived. I was feeling more nervous than
              with my first baby. How will the Argentine doctors do the surgery?
            </p>
            <p>
              The preparation for the surgery was very fast. I counted the minutes so that everything would end and have my baby in my arms.
              At 20 minutes, my baby was already with us. I still remember that they left me on the recovery table with my husband on the side who
              had the baby loaded. "What are you doing with the baby? and the incubator? "I asked.
            </p>
            <p>
              "The baby is perfect, they told me that he could stay with us". my husband told me. Once in a room, the nurse in charge of my recovery,
              I still remember his instructions. "Rest and NOT talk until the night and preferably not visits. Let me know when I'm ready to take a bath.
              "How can I not talk? How am I going to stop to take a bath? It was just a few hours after the surgery! "Madam is not sick, she had a baby.
              "What the nurse did not know was that my visits would be few but they would be the most necessary. I would be accompanied by my parents,
              my son Santiago and my husband.
            </p>
            <p>
              My recovery this time was so good, that the next day I was walking without problems and I was practically bathing myself. Not having talked
              allowed me not to take in more air and my belly swelled faster. And more importantly, my baby was already eating and his first night was
              very quiet. From this experience I learned that the important thing is the baby and the mother. Everything else as decoration, gifts, visits, etc.
              it is important but not necessary. With Juan Pablo, I took Argentine customs and breast-fed it without any kind of taboo for 18 months,
              in public places, and even when I was pregnant with the one who would paint our home in pink. That's right, our princess was missing and
              Maria Luciana would come to our family. Now we were living in Brazil.
            </p>
            <p>
              Again, my nerves as a new mother because, despite being my third baby, it was my first baby in Brazil! However, there were few differences
              that I found during the pregnancy control with Argentina, so that calmed me down and made me think that everything would be similar.
              Again cesarean, but I had my baby from the first moment of my recovery! She and I alone for hours in a recovery area. I really enjoyed those
              moments alone with her. Even though I felt a little sick because of the anesthesia, I even had nausea and vomiting but my daughter was there
              with me, calm and happy.
            </p>
            <p>
              In Mexico, when my baby was born, she went to the incubator while I recovered. In Argentina, my husband cared for the baby while I was recuperating at his side.
              In Brazil, my baby stayed with me during my recovery. Today I thank God for the opportunity to experience this experience three times in different ways.
              The question that many people ask me, "Where was it better to have a baby?" The truth could say that in Argentina it was where I felt that my recovery
              was better but the happiness of being a mother does not distinguish countries and I am happy to have lived these experiences.
              The example I received from Argentine mothers on breastfeeding changed my life and today I have been happily breastfeeding for more than 3 years.
              However, after being a new mother 3 times, I have come to the conclusion that breastfeeding or giving formula, natural birth or cesarean,
              co-sleeping or sleeping in separate rooms is 100% decision of the MOTHER. There will be those who are lazy to wash bottles (like me!)
              Or there will be someone who has to work and the bottles are the best option! Simply, I think that every mother should do what she thinks is right
              and be calm with her decisions, because if the mother is happy and calm, the rest of the family will be happy.
